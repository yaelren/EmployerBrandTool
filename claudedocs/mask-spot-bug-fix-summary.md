# Mask Spot Bug Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The mask spot component was showing a whitish overlay instead of revealing the background image when:
1. A background image was set
2. A background color was applied on top 
3. A spot was changed to "mask" type

Users expected to see the background image through the transparent mask window, but instead saw a whitish/gray overlay.

## Root Cause Analysis
The bug was located in `js/app.js` at line 1193 in the `render()` method:

```javascript
// BUGGY CODE (before fix):
spot.render(this.canvasManager.ctx, showOutline, showNumber);
```

The `Spot.render()` method signature requires a fourth parameter for the background image:
```javascript
render(ctx, showOutline = true, showNumber = true, backgroundImage = null)
```

Since the background image parameter was missing, mask spots always received `null` as the background image, causing them to render a placeholder overlay instead of revealing the actual background.

## Solution Implemented
Fixed the render call in `js/app.js` line 1193:

```javascript
// FIXED CODE:
spot.render(this.canvasManager.ctx, showOutline, showNumber, this.canvasManager.backgroundImage);
```

This change ensures that:
1. Mask spots receive the actual background image
2. The mask creates a transparent window revealing the background
3. The opacity control works as expected
4. High-resolution exports also work correctly (CanvasManager was already fixed)

## Testing Strategy
Created comprehensive Playwright tests:

1. **`tests/mask-spot-functionality.spec.js`** - Full test suite covering:
   - Spot detection and creation
   - Mask type controls and opacity
   - Background image upload and rendering
   - Canvas interaction and popup controls

2. **`tests/mask-fix-verification.spec.js`** - Specific test to verify the fix works
3. **`tests/mask-visual-test.spec.js`** - Visual demonstration showing the fix in action

## Test Results
All tests pass, confirming:
- ✅ Background image is properly passed to mask spots
- ✅ Mask spots now reveal background image instead of showing whitish overlay  
- ✅ Opacity controls work correctly (0-100%)
- ✅ Mask functionality works with background colors on top of images
- ✅ High-resolution exports include proper mask rendering

## Files Modified
- `js/app.js` - Fixed spot render call to include background image parameter

## Files Created for Testing
- `tests/mask-spot-functionality.spec.js` - Comprehensive test suite
- `tests/mask-fix-verification.spec.js` - Fix verification test
- `tests/mask-visual-test.spec.js` - Visual demonstration test
- `test-assets/test-bg.svg` - Test background image

## Verification
The fix has been verified through:
1. **Automated tests** - All Playwright tests pass
2. **Visual verification** - Screenshots show mask spots properly revealing background
3. **Functional testing** - Opacity controls and canvas interactions work correctly

## Impact
This fix resolves the core mask spot functionality, allowing users to:
- Create transparent windows that reveal background images
- Use mask spots as intended for design layouts
- Control mask opacity effectively
- Export high-resolution images with proper mask rendering

The mask spot feature now works as originally designed, providing a powerful tool for creating layered designs with selective background reveals.
